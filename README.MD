## Introduction
Possibly the simplest and easiest method to understand the steps in an algorithm, is by using flowchart method. This algorithm is composed of block symbols to represent each step in the solution process as well as the directed paths of each step.

### Advantages
*	Effective to express operation procedures clearly
*	Expressed graphically and easily understandable
*	With too much freedom allowed, it is rather difficult to keep structuring logic

### Basic Flowchart symbols

	C@{shape: lean-r, label: "Input/Output"}
	D@{shape: f-circ,label: "Connector"}
	E@{shape: diamond,label: "Decision"}
